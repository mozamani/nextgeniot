In this hands-on session, we will use [MXCHIP IoT DevKit](https://microsoft.github.io/azure-iot-developer-kit/) as our main IoT physical devices. These kits are equipied with OLED display, headphone, microphone, sensors like temperature, humidity, motion, pressure and Wifi helping us to build flexible IoT projects quickly. In addition to the DevKit, we would need (depending on the use-case):<br>

1) an Azure subscription
2) Azure IoT Hub instance
3) Azure Stream Analytics instance
4) Azure Machine Learning service
5) Azure Cognitive Services
6) Azure Functions 

A number of example projects using IoT DevKit can be found [here](https://microsoft.github.io/azure-iot-developer-kit/docs/projects/), including: 
Markup : * [Remote montitoring of temprature, pressure, humidity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-accelerators/iot-accelerators-arduino-iot-devkit-az3166-devkit-remote-monitoring-v2)
